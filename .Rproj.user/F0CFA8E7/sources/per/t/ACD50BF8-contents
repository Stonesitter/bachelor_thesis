This study explores  the impact of Media Multitasking on cognitive control, specifically focused attention, within the context of Intermediate Media Multitasking in comparison to Heavy/Light Media Multitasking. Following recommendations of current reviews of the media multitasking research, I employ the Media Multitasking Index to categorize individuals into Intermediate Media Multitaskers, Heavy Media Multitaskers, and Light Media Multitaskers, and to try to address certain gaps in the literature. Examining cognitive control through the lenses of cognitive flexibility, working memory, and inhibitory control, we  aim to elucidate the relationship between Media Multitasking and focused attention. Anticipating an inverse -U- correlation, our study employs a novel approach, integrating Media Multitasking Index scores with an experiment measuring focused attention during media consumption. The findings hold implications for understanding how distinct patterns of media use may influence cognitive control and, by extension, individuals' ability to navigate complex tasks amid increasing media saturation.
